# Telegram Bot

This is my test telegram boot based on [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/) and [BotMan](https://botman.io/).

## Installation

Oh... it's simple... Maybe:)

- You need to generate `TELEGRAM TOKEN KEY` in `BotFather` and put it in `.env` file
- Then you run `valet share` or something like this. !IMPORTANT! Telegram works only in `https://`
- Run `php artisan botman:telegram:register` and put here your url, like - https://example.com
